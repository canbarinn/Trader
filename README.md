## TODOS
1. Impl mock swap router
2. Write simple sanity tests for mock swap router
    1. Deploy two mock tokens (same contract)
    2. Deploy MockSwapRouter
    3. Then basic tests for sanity
3. Impl LimitTrader with at most one limit order (look at the comments)
    1. Same as above, plus deploy LimitTrader as well
    2. Basic tests for sanity

## Notes
Can add functions to interfaces at will
