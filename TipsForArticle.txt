WHY WE USE APPROVE AFTER TRANSFERFROM?

In the provided Solidity contract, the approve function is called after the safeTransferFrom function. This order is intentional and serves a specific purpose in the context of the contract's functionality.

In the given code, the contract is designed to perform swaps using Uniswap v3. Before executing a swap, the contract needs to transfer the required tokens from the caller to itself. The safeTransferFrom function is used for this purpose. It ensures that the contract receives the specified amount of tokens from the caller's address.

Once the tokens are transferred to the contract, the contract needs to approve the Uniswap router to spend those tokens on behalf of the contract. This is achieved through the safeApprove function. By approving the Uniswap router, the contract allows the router to transfer and use the tokens for the swap.

The reason for approving the router after the transfer is to ensure that the contract has the tokens in its possession before granting approval. This order helps prevent any potential race conditions or unexpected behaviors that could occur if approval were granted before the tokens were transferred.

By following this sequence of transferring tokens and then approving the router, the contract ensures that it has control over the tokens and explicitly grants permission to the router to spend those tokens.
